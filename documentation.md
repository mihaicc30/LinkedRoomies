  # Introduction

**LinkedRoomies** is a dynamic web application that is built using the latest technologies, including React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and Firebase. The aim of this project is to provide an efficient and reliable solution for university students who are searching for suitable accommodation and compatible roommates.

By using LinkedRoomies, students can easily browse through a range of options for accommodation and connect with other students who are looking for a compatible roommate. The app simplifies the process of finding a roommate who shares similar interests, habits, and preferences, making it easy to find a comfortable and welcoming living space.

The app is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Vite is used as a build tool and development server, which allows for fast and efficient development. Tailwind CSS is used for styling the app, providing a modern and responsive design that is optimized for all devices.

Firebase is used for the backend, providing features such as authentication, real-time database, and storage. This allows for secure and reliable data storage and retrieval, as well as easy integration with other Firebase products.

Overall, LinkedRoomies provides an all-in-one solution for university students who are looking for suitable accommodation and compatible roommates. With its modern design and user-friendly interface, it offers a seamless experience for users, simplifying the process of finding the perfect living space.

# Methodology

LinkedRoomies app utilizes a combined methodology of agile and design thinking. This approach involves a flexible and iterative process of development, where the focus is on understanding the user's needs and continually refining the app to meet those needs.

By combining these two methodologies, the LinkedRoomies app was able to create a highly user-focused product that was continually refined to meet the needs of the target audience. The app's development process involved frequent testing and iteration, where user feedback was used to refine the product.

# Methods

When evaluating a solution, it is important to collect feedback from users to gain insight into their experience and identify areas for improvement. To collect this feedback, a variety of data collection methods were employed.

One method used was surveys, which were distributed to a representative sample of users. These surveys allowed users to provide feedback on various aspects of the solution, including ease of use, functionality, and overall satisfaction. The results from these surveys were then analyzed to identify common themes and areas for improvement.

Another method used was user testing, which involved observing users as they interacted with the solution. This provided valuable insight into how users were using the solution and where they were encountering difficulties. The results from these tests were then used to make changes and improvements to the solution.

In addition, focus groups were also used to collect feedback from users. These groups allowed users to discuss their experiences with the solution in a more in-depth and interactive setting. This method provided valuable insights into user needs and preferences.

Overall, these data collection methods provided valuable insights into user experience and helped to identify areas for improvement. By using a variety of methods, the evaluation was able to gather a range of feedback and perspectives, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation of the solution.

# Conclusion
  

1.  **Interfaces**: The feedback received from the user testing showed that the interface was easy to understand and navigate. This suggests that the design of the interface was intuitive and user-friendly, which is crucial for ensuring a positive user experience.
2.  **Regional Structure**: The navigation bar was praised for being part of every screen and having all the main pages there to access, without being cluttered with information. This feedback highlights the importance of having a clear and accessible navigation structure, which can help users find what they need quickly and easily.
3.  **Colour scheme**: Testers found the color scheme to be a good choice, as it did not distract from the primary goal of the website. The use of appropriate colors can help create a visually appealing website that supports the user's goals, while also enhancing the overall user experience.
4.  **Visibility of system status**: Testers found the website and each screen easy to understand, but users were confused about how to review other students. As a result, a popup tooltip was added to make the review process more clear and intuitive. This feedback highlights the importance of ensuring that the user's actions and system status are clearly communicated at all times, to avoid confusion and enhance the overall user experience.
5.  **Content:** Most of the testers thought that the content was already enough for the solution proposed. This suggests that the content was relevant, engaging, and effectively communicated the necessary information to users.
6.  **User Experience:** The average feedback was that the experience was pleasant, but the lack of sounds or additional information would make the website something boring to use in the long run. This feedback suggests that there is room for improvement in terms of providing additional features and functionalities that can enhance the user experience and keep users engaged over time. It also highlights the importance of considering the user's overall experience when designing a website, not just focusing on the functionality and usability aspects.

The feedback received from users during the evaluation phase can be used to further improve the solution, thanks to the iterative approach of agile methodology. By continuously collecting and analyzing user feedback, the development team can make informed decisions about what features to add, modify, or remove from the solution. This allows for a more user-centered approach to development and helps ensure that the final product meets the needs and expectations of its intended users.
