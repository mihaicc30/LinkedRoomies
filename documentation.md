# Methods

  

It is critical to obtain feedback from users while reviewing a solution in order to acquire insight into their experience and suggest areas for improvement. A variety of data collection approaches were used to acquire this input.

  

Surveys were delivered to a representative sample of customers as one way. Users were able to submit feedback on several areas of the solution, such as simplicity of use, functionality, and overall satisfaction, using these questionnaires. These surveys' responses were then examined to uncover common themes and opportunities for improvement.

  

User testing was another technique utilised, which involved observing users as they interacted with the solution. This offered vital insight into how users were interacting with the system and where they were having issues. The findings of these tests were then used to modify and improve the solution.

  

In addition, focus groups were conducted to gather customer feedback. These groups provided a more in-depth and participatory forum for users to discuss their experiences with the solution. This strategy revealed important information about user wants and preferences.

  

Overall, these data collection methods provided valuable insights into user experience and helped to identify areas for improvement. By using a variety of methods, the evaluation was able to gather a range of feedback and perspectives, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation of the solution.

  

# Conclusion

  

1.  **Interfaces**: The user testing results indicated that the interface was simple to grasp and navigate. This indicates that the interface was designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, which is critical for creating a favourable user experience.

  

2.  **Regional Structure**: The navigation bar was appreciated for being a part of every screen and for providing access to all of the important sites without being cluttered with information. This feedback emphasises the necessity of having a clear and accessible navigation structure that allows visitors to swiftly and easily find what they need.

  

3.  **Colour scheme**: The colour palette was deemed appropriate by testers because it did not detract from the website's core aim. Colours can be used to create a visually appealing website that supports the user's goals while also improving the overall user experience.

  

4.  **Visibility of system status**: The website and each panel were straightforward to comprehend for testers, but users were perplexed about how to review other students. As a result, a popup tooltip was introduced to clarify and improve the review process. This comment emphasises the need of clearly communicating the user's activities and system status at all times in order to reduce confusion and improve the overall user experience.

  

5.  **Content**: The majority of the testers believed that the information was sufficient for the proposed solution. This indicates that the content was relevant, engaging, and effectively communicated the required information to users.

  

6.  **User Experience**: The overall impression was positive, but the lack of noises or other information would make visiting the website monotonous in the long term. This feedback suggests that there is room for development in terms of adding new features and functionalities that will improve the user experience and keep consumers engaged in the long run. It also highlights the significance of designing a website with the entire user experience in mind, rather than simply the functionality and usability components.

  
  

Because agile approach is iterative, the feedback obtained from users during the evaluation phase can be used to further enhance the solution. The development team may make educated judgements about what features to add, change, or remove from the solution by regularly gathering and analysing customer feedback. This enables for a more user-centered development approach, which helps guarantee that the final product satisfies the needs and expectations of its intended consumers.
